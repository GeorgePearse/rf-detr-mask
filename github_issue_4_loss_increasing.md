# Issue: Loss Increasing After Recent Changes

## Description
The model training previously showed proper loss decrease, but after recent changes the loss is now increasing. This indicates a potential regression in the model architecture or training process.

## Analysis

### Two-Stage Feature Removal
- The commit history shows a commit with message "removed 2 stage" (17726e8).
- In the current implementation, the `two_stage` parameter has been completely removed from the `LWDETR` class in `rfdetr/models/lwdetr.py`.
- However, the code previously used conditional logic based on this parameter to determine when to add encoder outputs to the final output dictionary.
- The current implementation now unconditionally adds encoder outputs to the result dictionary.

### Key Code Changes

1. **LWDETR Class Constructor:**
   - Before: Included `two_stage=False` parameter
   - After: Parameter removed, but related encoder output embedding setup is now unconditionally applied

2. **Forward Method:**
   - Before: Wrapped encoder output handling in a conditional `if self.two_stage:` block
   - After: Encoder output handling runs unconditionally 

3. **Window Attention Implementation:**
   - Potential issue found in `dinov2_with_windowed_attn.py` where a bug fix was implemented in line 364:
   ```python
   # Fixed: This was incorrectly using num_h_patches_per_window
   num_w_patches_per_window
   ```
   - This could affect the shape of tensors flowing through the model

4. **Error Handling:**
   - New `TrainingError` class introduced in `rfdetr/util/error_handling.py`, replacing generic `ValueError` for more specific error handling
   - However, this would improve reporting rather than cause the issue directly

## Hypothesis
Based on the analysis, the most likely causes of the increasing loss are:

1. **Encoder Output Usage Without Two-Stage Logic**: 
   - Since we're now unconditionally using encoder outputs instead of conditionally based on `two_stage`, this may be forcing the model to use intermediate features that aren't well-trained for the specific task.
   - The model is now computing loss for encoder outputs even when not appropriate.

2. **Incorrect Tensor Shapes**:
   - The fix in `dinov2_with_windowed_attn.py` suggests there was a bug in tensor reshaping during window attention.
   - This could potentially cause misaligned features that propagate to loss computations.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Train the model using the current codebase
2. Observe increasing loss values during training
3. Compare with training runs from before commit 17726e8 ("removed 2 stage")

## Recommended Actions

1. **Restore Two-Stage Conditionality**:
   - Reintroduce the `two_stage` parameter, defaulting to `False`
   - Wrap the encoder output handling in the conditional again
   - Test if this resolves the issue

2. **Verify Tensor Shapes**:
   - Add shape validation at key points in the model to ensure tensors have expected shapes
   - Pay special attention to the window attention reshaping operations

3. **Check Loss Computation**:
   - Verify that loss computation handles encoder outputs correctly
   - Ensure no double-counting or incorrect weighting of loss components

## Additional Context
The `build_model` function in `lwdetr.py` has also been updated to use Pydantic models for configuration, which could potentially impact how default parameters are set. This could lead to unexpected configuration differences between the previous and current implementation.
