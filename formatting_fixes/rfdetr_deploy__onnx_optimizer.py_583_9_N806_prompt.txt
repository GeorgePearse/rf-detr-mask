Here's the current code:
        # Input number of channels to Q, K and V
        c = weights_k.shape[0]
        # Number of heads
        h = heads
        # Hidden dimension per head
        d = weights_k.shape[1] // h

        # Concat and interleave weights such that the output of fused QKV GEMM has [b, s, h, 3, d] shape
        weights_qkv = np.dstack(

Return only the corrected code snippet, nothing else. No explanations.
