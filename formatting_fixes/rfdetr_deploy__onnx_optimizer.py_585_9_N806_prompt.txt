Fix the following Python formatting error N806 in rfdetr/deploy/_onnx/optimizer.py at line 585, column 9:

583 |         H = heads
584 |         # Hidden dimension per head
585 |         D = weights_k.shape[1] // H

rfdetr/deploy/benchmark.py:216:1: E402 Module level import not at top of file
    |

Here's the current code:
        # Number of heads
        h = heads
        # Hidden dimension per head
        d = weights_k.shape[1] // h

        # Concat and interleave weights such that the output of fused QKV GEMM has [b, s, h, 3, d] shape
        weights_qkv = np.dstack(
            [weights_q.reshape(c, h, d), weights_k.reshape(c, h, d), weights_v.reshape(c, h, d)]
        ).reshape(c, 3 * h * d)

Return only the corrected code snippet, nothing else. No explanations.
