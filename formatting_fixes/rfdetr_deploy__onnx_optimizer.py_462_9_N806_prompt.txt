rfdetr/deploy/_onnx/optimizer.py:464:9: N806 Variable `D` in function should be lowercase

Here's the current code:
        # Input number of channels to K and V
        C = weights_k.shape[0]
        # Number of heads
        H = heads
        # Dimension per head
        D = weights_k.shape[1] // H

        # Concat and interleave weights such that the output of fused KV GEMM has [b, s_kv, h, 2, d] shape
        weights_kv = np.dstack([weights_k.reshape(C, H, D), weights_v.reshape(C, H, D)]).reshape(

Return only the corrected code snippet, nothing else. No explanations.
