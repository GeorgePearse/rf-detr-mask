Fix the following Python formatting error N806 in rfdetr/deploy/_onnx/optimizer.py at line 581, column 9:

Error details:
    |
580 |         # Input number of channels to Q, K and V
581 |         C = weights_k.shape[0]
    |         ^ N806
582 |         # Number of heads
583 |         H = heads
    |
rfdetr/deploy/_onnx/optimizer.py:583:9: N806 Variable `H` in function should be lowercase
    |
581 |         C = weights_k.shape[0]

Here's the current code:
        weights_v = node_v.inputs[1].values

        # Input number of channels to Q, K and V
        C = weights_k.shape[0]
        # Number of heads
        H = heads
        # Hidden dimension per head
        d = weights_k.shape[1] // H

Return only the corrected code snippet, nothing else. No explanations.
