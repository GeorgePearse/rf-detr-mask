Fix the following Python formatting error N806 in rfdetr/deploy/_onnx/optimizer.py at line 464, column 9:

Error details:

462 |         H = heads
463 |         # Dimension per head
464 |         D = weights_k.shape[1] // H
    |         ^ N806

466 |         # Concat and interleave weights such that the output of fused KV GEMM has [b, s_kv, h, 2, d] shape
    |
rfdetr/deploy/_onnx/optimizer.py:581:9: N806 Variable `C` in function should be lowercase
    |

Here's the current code:
        # Number of heads
        H = heads
        # Dimension per head
        d = weights_k.shape[1] // H

        # Concat and interleave weights such that the output of fused KV GEMM has [b, s_kv, h, 2, d] shape
        weights_kv = np.dstack([weights_k.reshape(C, H, d), weights_v.reshape(C, H, d)]).reshape(
            C, 2 * H * d
        )

Return only the corrected code snippet, nothing else. No explanations.
