Fix the following Python formatting error N806 in rfdetr/deploy/_onnx/optimizer.py at line 460, column 9:

Error details:
    |
458 |         weights_v = node_v.inputs[1].values
459 |         # Input number of channels to K and V
460 |         C = weights_k.shape[0]
    |         ^ N806
461 |         # Number of heads
462 |         H = heads
    |
rfdetr/deploy/_onnx/optimizer.py:462:9: N806 Variable `H` in function should be lowercase
    |

Here's the current code:
        # Get weights of V
        weights_v = node_v.inputs[1].values
        # Input number of channels to K and V
        C = weights_k.shape[0]
        # Number of heads
        H = heads
        # Dimension per head
        D = weights_k.shape[1] // H

Return only the corrected code snippet, nothing else. No explanations.
