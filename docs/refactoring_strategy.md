# RF-DETR Refactoring Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for testing and migrating from the god object pattern to the new refactored architecture.

## Recommended Approach: Component-Level Integration Testing

After analyzing the codebase, the recommended approach is **Option 3: Create integration tests for individual components**. This provides the best balance of safety, thoroughness, and development velocity.

## Why Component Testing?

1. **Lower Risk**: Test refactored components without affecting production code
2. **Incremental Validation**: Verify each component works before integration
3. **Better Coverage**: Component tests are more granular than full training runs
4. **Faster Feedback**: Component tests run quickly compared to full training
5. **Parallel Development**: Old and new code can coexist during migration

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Component Validation (Current)
- Individual component tests (`test_refactored_integration.py`)
- Compatibility tests (`test_refactored_compatibility.py`)
- Type checking and linting
- Quick smoke tests

### Phase 2: Integration Examples
- Example training script (`train_with_refactored_components.py`)
- Side-by-side comparison with legacy code
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory usage analysis

### Phase 3: Gradual Migration
- Add `--use-refactored` flag to existing train.py
- A/B testing in production
- Monitoring and metrics collection
- Progressive rollout

### Phase 4: Full Migration
- Update main training script
- Deprecate legacy code
- Update documentation
- Archive old implementation

```

## Running Tests

1. **Validate all components:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_refactoring.py
   ```

2. **Run specific component tests:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/integration/test_refactored_integration.py -v
   ```

3. **Test backward compatibility:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/integration/test_refactored_compatibility.py -v
   ```

4. **Quick training test (legacy):**
   ```bash
   python scripts/train.py --steps_per_validation 20 --test_limit 20
   ```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Safety First**: No changes to production code until fully validated
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Every component is tested individually and together
3. **Easy Rollback**: Can revert to legacy code at any time
4. **Clear Migration Path**: Step-by-step process with checkpoints
5. **Maintainable**: Clean separation between old and new code

## Next Steps

1. Run `python scripts/validate_refactoring.py` to ensure all tests pass
2. Review component implementations in `rfdetr/core/`
3. Try the example training script with test data
4. Plan migration timeline based on test results
5. Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
